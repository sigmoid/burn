# Updated Texture Loading System

The EntityFactory and SpriteComponent have been updated to support loading textures from both texture atlases and direct file paths.

## How It Works

When creating sprites through XML definitions or the EntityFactory, the system now follows this fallback hierarchy:

1. **First**: Try to load from the texture atlas using `Core.TextureAtlas.GetRegion(textureName)`
2. **Fallback**: If texture atlas loading fails, try to load directly from file using `Core.Content.Load<Texture2D>(texturePath)`

## Usage Examples

### XML Entity Definition
```xml
<Entity Name="MyEntity">
    <Position>
        <X>100</X>
        <Y>100</Y>
    </Position>
    <Component Type="SpriteComponent">
        <!-- This can now be either a texture atlas region name OR a direct file path -->
        <Property Name="Texture" Value="images/icons/log-icon" />
        <Property Name="LayerDepth" Value="0.5" />
    </Component>
</Entity>
```

### Code Usage
```csharp
// This will work with both atlas regions and direct file paths
var spriteComponent = new SpriteComponent("images/icons/log-icon");
```

## Backward Compatibility

The system is fully backward compatible:
- Existing XML files and code that use texture atlas region names will continue to work
- The texture atlas is still tried first, so performance is maintained for atlas-based textures
- Only when atlas loading fails does the system fall back to direct file loading

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Can now use textures that aren't in the main texture atlas
2. **Easier Development**: No need to add every texture to the atlas during development
3. **Backward Compatible**: Existing code continues to work unchanged
4. **Performance**: Atlas textures are still preferred and loaded first

## Error Handling

- If both atlas and file loading fail, an empty sprite is created and an error is logged
- Detailed error messages help identify what went wrong during loading
- The system gracefully handles cases where TextureAtlas or ContentManager are unavailable
