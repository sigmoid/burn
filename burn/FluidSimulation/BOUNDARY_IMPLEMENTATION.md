# Boundary Program Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds the boundary condition handling from NVIDIA GPU Gems Chapter 38 "Fast Fluid Dynamics Simulation on the GPU" to the fluid simulation. The boundary program ensures proper fluid behavior at the edges of the simulation domain.

## Key Features

### 1. GPU Gems Compliance
- Implements the exact boundary conditions described in the paper
- Uses the recommended "slab operations" approach
- Handles both velocity (no-slip) and pressure (Neumann) boundary conditions

### 2. Boundary Types

#### No-Slip Velocity Boundaries
- For velocity fields: `BoundaryType.Velocity`
- Sets boundary velocity = -interior_velocity
- Creates "sticky" walls where fluid velocity goes to zero

#### Neumann Pressure Boundaries  
- For pressure fields: `BoundaryType.Pressure`
- Sets boundary pressure = interior_pressure
- Ensures zero pressure gradient normal to boundaries

#### Copy Boundaries
- For other fields: `BoundaryType.Other`
- Simply copies interior values to boundaries
- Used for fuel, temperature, obstacles, etc.

### 3. Implementation Details

#### BoundaryStep.cs
- Core boundary condition step following GPU Gems methodology
- Draws boundary quads to update only border pixels
- Uses shader parameters for offset and scale control

#### Shader Support (FluidEffect.fx)
- Added `BoundaryPS` pixel shader for boundary conditions
- Added `CopyPS` pixel shader for interior preservation
- Uses `boundaryOffset` and `boundaryScale` parameters

#### Integration
- Applied after each major simulation step as recommended
- Follows the stable fluids algorithm sequence from the paper
- Maintains proper boundary conditions throughout simulation

## Algorithm Flow

1. **Advection** → Apply velocity boundaries
2. **Viscous Diffusion** → Apply velocity boundaries  
3. **External Forces** (handled in AddForce methods)
4. **Projection**:
   - Compute divergence → Apply divergence boundaries
   - Solve pressure → Apply pressure boundaries (Neumann)
   - Project velocity → Apply velocity boundaries
5. **Vorticity Confinement** → Apply velocity boundaries
6. **Combustion Effects** → Apply fuel/temperature boundaries
7. **Obstacles** → Apply obstacle boundaries

## Benefits

- **Stability**: Prevents numerical instabilities at boundaries
- **Realism**: Proper no-slip conditions create realistic wall interactions
- **Accuracy**: Follows proven GPU Gems methodology
- **Performance**: Efficient GPU implementation using quad rendering

## Usage

The boundary conditions are automatically applied during simulation. No manual intervention is required. The system will:

- Keep velocity at walls to zero (no-slip condition)
- Maintain proper pressure gradients
- Handle obstacles correctly
- Preserve fuel and temperature boundary behavior
